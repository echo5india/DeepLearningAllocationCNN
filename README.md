# DeepLearningAllocationCNN

In this project, we aim to implement Convolutional Neural Networks for portfolio selection. In order to fully utilize the advantage of CNN on feature caption and image classification, we converted time series stock data into 2D images first by several different algorithms. Then we used GoogLeNet, AlexNet and ResNet for training, validation and testing. Fi- nally we examined the performance of CNN-based strategy against S&P 500, and the result of GoogLeNet showcases a strong predictive power and feasible future extensions. We also talked about future improvements that could be done on this project.
