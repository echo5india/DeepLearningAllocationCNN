** Backtest
    - Create a module that enables the easy backtest from a given period of time and given stocks and criteria(on the probabilities given by the model)
    - probably by restoring weights of a specific model and doing the predictions instead of loading them

**Training
    - Code the save/restore part with the tensorflow saver and understand how to use it optimally
    - Learn how to use the cloud to actually train the model
    - use tf.add_to_collection and tf.get_collections in order to restore a model properly

**Dataprocessing:
    - allow for different targets than VWAP returns (close prices ??)

    - allow for the training on only a subset of stocks

    - build different targets according to the level of returns (ex put the threshold at +1% so that maybe we can capt more trends and not only special events)
    - should we think about getting returns before GADF ?
    - Build functions (static_method first) to build the right features from the raw dataframe retrieved on CRSP
            + Simple: example bid-ask spread, returns ...

    # TODO functions:
    _get_data_from_stocks in data_processing
    _build_close_returns in data_processing


**Modify the function next_batch and add options:
    - shuffle at each minibatch
    - go over the whole dataset during the epoch (what is actually done with the shuffling at each epoch)


** Implement other structures
    - ResNET
    - try to smooth the data beforehand (Fourrier, Wavelet)
    - twist the hyperparameters
    - add batch normalization

    - tf.layers.conv2d use it with dilatation rate to identify patterns

**Get other data from CRSP
    - at list company names so we can understand the backtest
    - build indicators ? ex moving average etc (look up articles of finance about this)
    - maybe other features: dividends...
    - maybe returns from another index or macroeconomic level that we would consider as another channel (ex: interest rates, unemployment...)



**Use several GPU

**Try to predict volatility changes instead of returns movements ?
    - Concretely we would have to change the targets
    - maybe try predictions after more than 1 week ?
    - Backtest using Delta-Hedged ATM options ?
